"""The plugin: one source, `github.inbox`, that proposes a task per message.

The core's plugin host starts this module as an MCP server over stdio (`python -m
horae_github`). The plugin never writes anything: it returns data and proposes intents,
which the core checks against `plugin.yaml`'s permissions, shows as a dry-run diff and
applies.

A message comes from a service the plugin does not control, so its fields are **untrusted**:
the subject reaches the task title only through `intents.task_create`, which escapes it for
Obsidian Tasks (a subject holding `📅 2020-01-01` must not schedule the task).
